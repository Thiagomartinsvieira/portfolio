      Full Stack Developer with experience in developing modern front-end and back-end solutions. On the front-end, I work with React, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, creating responsive and high-performance interfaces.

Currently, I work as a Front-end Developer at ComHub, where I contribute to building applications using Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I have experience consuming REST APIs, integrating with WebSocket, using libraries like Axios, and applying best development practices to deliver modern and scalable experiences.

On the back-end, I have knowledge of Node.js, Express, PHP, and Java with Spring Boot, as well as familiarity with databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.

I also have experience with WordPress, including theme and plugin customization, as well as knowledge of hosting, domain configuration, and optimization with Cloudflare.

Proficient in Linux, Git, and collaboration tools, I am always seeking new challenges, continuous improvement, and opportunities that allow me to grow professionally and contribute innovative solutions.
